# Lamba
Just keeping notes
Here test.java file won't oompile but test1.java will compile.
Reason for this is:
Implementing Lamba expression mean we are implementing te functional interface.
It should have one abstract method, because at the time of lambda expression, we can provide only one implementation at once
